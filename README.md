<p><strong>SAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>In this folder are several samples selected to reflect the kinds of documents and issues that we talked about in my interviews with the Wi-Fi Alliance.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sample 1</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="examples/sample1_readme.png">sample1_readme.png</a>): The links at the top of this readme show the standardization we made to all readmes at NI, including OS support, system requirements, NI application software support, security, new features, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Sample 2</strong> (<a target="_blank"  href="examples/sample2_API_documentation.png">sample2_API_documentation.png</a>): This document shows an example of a templatized form of API documentation for the NI LabVIEW CVI product, which is a C compiler.</li>
  <li><strong>Sample 3</strong> (<a  target="_blank" href="examples/sample3_specs_hardware.pdf">sample3_specs_hardware.pdf</a>): This appendix shows framegrabber (image acquisition) specifications. The specifications in all NI hardware documents were based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) styles and recommendations.</li>
  <li><strong>Samples 4 and 5</strong> (<a target="_blank"  href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/pykrylov-accelerating-machine-learning-research-at-ebay/">https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/pykrylov-accelerating-machine-learning-research-at-ebay/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/speed-by-a-thousand-cuts/">https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/speed-by-a-thousand-cuts/</a>): These samples are two of the articles that I edited and published on eBay Tech Blog in 2020. </li>
